          How can I participate in cooking classes or other events?
        </h3>
        <p>
          You can participate by filling out a form that registers you for these
          events, but keep in mind that the type of registration could vary
          depending on the events and their hosts.
        </p>
        <h3 id="1-2">
          Are there prerequisites for joining certain activities?
        </h3>
        <p>
          In most cases these activities are open to anyone interested, however,
          a few may contain some small prerequisites.

        <h2 id="2">Community Engagement:</h2>
        <h3 id="2-1">How can I connect with other members of the community?</h3>
        <p>
          You will connect with them through the events/activities that will be
          organized, and if perhaps you havenâ€™t had the chance to get their
          contact information, we could try to send it to you with their
          consent.

        <h3 id="2-2">
          Can I submit my own content or suggestions for the website?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Of course! Just email us and we will help you further with your
          request.
